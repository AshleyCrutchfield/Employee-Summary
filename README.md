# Employee-Summary
# About
The purpose of this application is to allow for managers to add employees to an HTML page by using Node.js. 
# Development
I have developed a framework to push the user data into with the use of Classes. I then used Inquirer in order to develop a questionaire that would branch into different questions. Once the app received the user's information it pushed the data into the "team.html" page.
